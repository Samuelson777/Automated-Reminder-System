# Automated Reminder System

## Overview

The **Automated Reminder System** is a Python-based application that allows users to set reminders and receive notifications via email or desktop alerts. This project demonstrates automation skills by utilizing scheduling, email handling, and notification libraries in Python.

## Features

- **Add Reminders**: Users can set reminders with a message and a specific time.
- **Email Notifications**: The system sends email reminders to the user.
- **Desktop Notifications**: Users receive desktop notifications at the scheduled time.
- **User -Friendly Interface**: Simple command-line interface for easy interaction.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `smtplib` for sending emails
  - `schedule` for scheduling tasks
  - `time` for handling time-related functions
  - `plyer` for desktop notifications

## Usage
- Run the script:

- Follow the prompts to enter your email address, set a reminder time (in HH:MM format), and enter a reminder message.

- Ensure your computer is running at the time of the reminder to receive notifications

## Conclusion
The Automated Reminder System project is a practical application that showcases automation skills using Python. By implementing this project, users learn how to schedule tasks, send emails programmatically, and create desktop notifications. This project serves as a foundation for further exploration into more complex automation tasks and applications.

## Future Enhancements
To improve and expand the functionality of the Automated Reminder System, consider the following enhancements:

- **Persistent Storage**: Implement a database or file-based storage to save reminders.
- **User Interface**: Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier interaction.
- **Multiple Reminder Types**: Allow users to choose different types of reminders (e.g., SMS, push notifications).
- **Recurring Reminders**: Add functionality for daily, weekly, or monthly reminders.
- **Customizable Notification Settings**: Enable users to customize notification preferences.
- **User Authentication**: Implement user authentication for secure reminder management.
- **Web-Based Version**: Develop a web application version using Flask or Django.
- **Integration with Calendar APIs**: Sync reminders with Google Calendar or Outlook.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Allow users to input reminders in a conversational manner.
- **Mobile Application**: Create a mobile app version using React Native or Flutter.
